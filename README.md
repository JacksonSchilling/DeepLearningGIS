# DeepLearningGIS

This repository contains files necessary for the Spatial Analysis Lab and other UVM affiliates to use deep learning for GIS. The tutorials contained in this repository are simplified to allow those who are familiar with GIS but new to deep learning use these tools for their research. There is also highly accurate training data made available by the Spatial Analysis Lab contained in the training data folder for those that want to experiment with training their model.
